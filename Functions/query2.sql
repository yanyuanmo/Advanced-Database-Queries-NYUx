-- Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Orders table:

-- The order_date column
-- A column that uses the DATE_FORMAT function to return the four-digit year thatâ€™s stored in the order_date column.  Alias the column order_year
-- A column that uses the DATE_FORMAT function to return the order_date column in this format: Mon-DD-YYYY. In other words, use abbreviated months and separate each date component with dashes. Alias the column order_date_formatted
-- A column that uses the DATE_FORMAT function to return the order_date column with only the hours and minutes on a 12-hour clock with an am/pm indicator. Alias the column order_time
-- A column that uses the DATE_FORMAT function to return the order_date column in this format: MM/DD/YY HH:MM. In other words, use two-digit months, days, and years and separate them by slashes. Use 2-digit hours and minutes on a 24-hour clock. And use leading zeros for all date/time components. Alias the column  order_datetime
-- Sort the result set by the order_date column in ascending sequence.
