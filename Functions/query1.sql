SELECT list_price, discount_percent, ROUND(list_price*discount_percent/100, 2) as discount_amount
FROM products
ORDER BY discount_amount

-- Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Products table:


-- The list_price column
-- The discount_percent column
-- A column named discount_amount that uses the previous two columns to calculate the discount amount and uses the ROUND function to round the result so it has 2 decimal digits
-- Sort the result set by the discount_amount column in ascending sequence.


-- Store the query in a file named query.sql and upload to GradeScope below
